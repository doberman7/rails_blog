<!-- In this case, it's the symbol :article. This tells the form_for helper what this form is for. Inside the block for this method, the FormBuilder object - represented by f - is used to build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and text of an article. Finally, a call to submit on the f object will create a submit button for the form. -->
